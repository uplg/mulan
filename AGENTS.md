The goal of this project is to create a "state of the art" frontend to use the HeartMuLa MLX model.

GOAL : Optimize sound generation time, it works flawlessly but is very slow after generating. Probably a decode or something like that that takes a lot of time.

You need to split in correct minimal steps.

Don't overthink.

DO NOT use sub-agents. You don't need them.

DO NOT run long-running command. DO NOT try to start the frontend or backend.

Use your specific python-best-practices fastapi-expert or react-expert skill when needed.
